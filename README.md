# Mapping_Earthquakes

In this challenge we are mapping earthquakes and displaying the information in an easily digestable visulization hosted on a web page. We are using a variety of tools to accomplish this task JavaScript is used to handle to the logic side of the challenge, the web page is coded in you guessed it HTML and has a few CSS elements tied into. 

# Data_Description
We used Mapbox to pull the earthquake data via an API key. On the map itself we have three views availiable to us Streets, Satellite, and night view last one is pretty cool. Addtionally we included data about each earthquakes location and magnitude, then we added an overlay showing the location of the tectonic plates as a visual aid to help viewers see what relationship might exist between earthquake location relative to the tectonic plates. 

# Things to add
One drawback to this map is that does not include information about active fault lines that run through the continents. Adding this would help users visualize why earthquakes might be happening in the middle of continents as opposed to just along the fault lines. If you look at the visulization it makes sense that you would see alot of earthquakes along the west coast of north america which is where the pacific tectonic plates meets with the north american tectonic plate.

When you look at Oklahoma and Kansas you see alot of earthquakes tightly clustered in the region, but no tectonic plates meet there so what gives? Turns out there is an active fault line that runs through both states who knew?

Adding in active fault line information would be extremley beneficial to the user experience of this visulization.
